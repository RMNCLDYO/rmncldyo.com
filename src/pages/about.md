Welcome,

I'm Ray. A software developer who believes in building useful tools and sharing them with the community. I write code that I'd want to use myself, and I try to make it as clean and accessible as possible.

### What You'll Find Here

I'll be sharing:

- Open source projects I'm working on
- Technical deep-dives and tutorials
- Tools and libraries that make our lives easier
- Lessons learned from building software
- Occasional thoughts on the state of development

### Let's Build Together

Got questions? Want to collaborate on something? Found a bug in one of my projects? Shoot me a message at _[hi@rmncldyo.com](mailto:hi@rmncldyo.com)_.

You can find my work on ***[GitHub](https://github.com/rmnldyo)***, and I'm always open to feedback and contributions.

- Ray
